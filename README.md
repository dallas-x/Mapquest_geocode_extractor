# Mapquest_geocode_extractor
Will extract Geo Coordinates from Mapquest url

I will be updating the readme later, i would like to add a feature to create a KML file from mapquest link.

This application was originally to help a friend who's bike's gps would only accept grid cordinates or kml file. 
Error handling and input validation coming in next push.
